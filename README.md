This webpage is dedicated mainly to showcase all of TWICE's (KPOP Girl Group) members profile. It will also add a page of their popular albums (total of 9) on one page. The reason i chose to make a profile for TWICE is because they are a large girl group and i thought it would be good to make a profile page for them. As a user, I would wish to be able to access all their infos without the need to think about where to navigate to find out the particular member's info. Hence, i have made it such that by simply clicking on the member's face, it would bring them to the member's info page already. I have also added "back" and "next" buttons at the bottom corners of the page to easily navigate through the members without the need to go back to the mainpage. Buttons linking to their social medias have also been added at the bottom center of each page for easy convenience to their social media profiles. Lastly, i have added a dropdown menu for users to be able to access each member's page as well as the popular albums page. I decided to go with a light theme for this webpage as my webpage is about a girlgroup and hence a lighter colour would be a better fit for the theme.
